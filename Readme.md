  <strong>
As a Computer Science student at BRAC University, I am dedicated to advancing my knowledge and skills in Natural Language Processing. My academic pursuits are complemented by my role as a part-time remote Trainee Software Developer at Home&Out, a USA-based start-up. Additionally, I support various USA-based companies by developing data scraping applications for social media platforms. Furthermore, my extracurricular activities include significant contributions to BRACU Dichari, where I gained valuable experience working with embedded systems as part of the AI and control sub-team. Moreover, my leadership abilities are evidenced by my service as an HR for multiple subteams. My industry involvement is further highlighted by my roles as an Approver at the Cloud-Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and as a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador. In terms of technical expertise, I have substantial experience in industrial-level backend development using technologies such as Node.js, FastAPI, and Next.js, and have developed front-end applications with React and Svelte. My database expertise includes working with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB, and I am proficient in using Prisma ORM. For web scraping, I utilize tools like Selenium (Python), Proxy, and Beautiful Soup. Additionally, in the realm of DevOps, I am skilled in Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Terraform, ArgoCD, Grafana, and Prometheus. I also have experience deploying apps in Azure cloud service. My deep learning experience spans over two years, during which I have developed models using Keras, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. I have also worked on chatbot-building projects that involved Langchain. Lastly, my research interests encompass deep learning, computer vision, machine learning, robotics, and blockchain. I am passionate about contributing to impactful projects and aspire to make a positive impact in the tech industry.
